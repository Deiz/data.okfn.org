## Publishing Geodata (Geospatial Data)

Note: this focuses on *vector* geodata -- i.e. points, lines polygons etc (not
imagery or raster data).

Unlike tabular data we don't have a single specific recommendation for the
geodata format to use when publishing geodata.

Instead we recommend a few formats and show how you would publish these.


## GeoJSON

## TopoJSON

## KML 

We recommend against KML compared to GeoJSON.

## Shapefiles

We recommend against Shapefiles due to there proprietary nature and somewhat
complex structure. However, it is a common geodata format so we explain here
how to publish these.
