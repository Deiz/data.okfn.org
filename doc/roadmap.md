There are three strands of activity:

* Standards - speccing out the "Data Package" concept
* Publishing and Using Data (Packages) - building out tools and integrations to make it easy to publish and use Data Packages
* Documentation, Outreach and Community - engaging and evangelizing around the concepts, standards and tooling

This diagram gives a high-level overview of these:

## Data Package "Standards"

Lightweight, RFC-style proposals and patterns covering topics such as:

* Data Package (core spec)
* Data Package Tabular Data Profile - aka Simple Data Format
* Data Package Geo Data Profile - aka Simple Geo Data Format
* Schemas

## Tooling &amp; Integration

Building out tooling and integrations to make it easy to **publish** and **use** data (packages).

### Core Tools

* Data Package core JSON lib
* Command line tool for Data Packages - "Data Package Manager"
* Core libraries - python, ruby, Java, R, etc
* Online tool for creating and viewing Data Packages - data.okfn.org
* The Registry - a place to publish and pull from
* Support for syncing and patching data to support real-time updating and efficient sharing (data is big relevative to code!)

### Integration

Its must be incredibly easy to share and use "packaged" data from standard tools

* R, Excel, Google Docs etc
* Databases, DaaS (e.g. BigQuery, Redshift etc)
* OpenRefine, ...
* One click Data API
* ...

## Documentation, Outreach and Community

Engaging and evangelizing around the concepts, standards and tooling including:

* Website with overview, introduction, tool listing
* Tutorials, code examples etc
* Talks and meetups
- Outreach and evangelism to build adoption
* Publishing and Using Tutorial
* Community Events and Meetups

# Detailed Roadmap with Status and Workstreams

# Related Activities

There's a lot of other things that we want to see built to make a more
Frictionless Data ecosystem.

We list some of these items here but emphasize:

* Our focus is on the main items above
* There's a lot here so we don't anticipating all of this getting done immediately
* Quite a bit already exists that is relevant and so it may less about creating new things but instead its about joining up what's there, about creating and sharing patterns that work

## The List

- Lightweight Data Packages Catalog (JS+HTML)
- Data Explorer - wrangle data and create packages in your browser
- Pre-prepared Essential datasets in the standard format - high quality data is important (little incentive to use or improve if most data is bad data)
- Data converters - make it easy to convert between different formats
- Data cleaning services
