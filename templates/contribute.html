    <h2>Contributing Datasets</h2>
    <p>Anyone can suggest or contribute data to the project. Note that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We are not a general registry for data &ndash; we have specific criteria for what we'll accept</li>
      <li>We package data rather than create it &ndash; our focus is to take source data and ensure it is of high quality and in a standard form</li>
      <li>We preserve a clean separation between the data source, the dta package and this registry &ndash; for example, data packages are stored in git repos hosted separately (preferably github)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Suggest a Dataset</h4>
    <p>To propose a dataset for addition you <a href="https://github.com/datasets/registry/issues/new">open an issue in the Registry</a> with the details of the proposed dataset.</p>

    <h4>Preparing and Submitting a Dataset</h4>
    <p>The key steps are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Prepare the dataset &ndash; <a href="#prepare">detailed instructions below</a></li>
      <li>Open an issue for review &ndash; the submission will be reviewed against the <a href="#assessment">assessment criteria</a></li>
      <li>On approval: add to the <a href="https://github.com/datasets/registry">registry list</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="prepare">Preparing a Dataset</h3>
    <p>All datasets MUST be provided in source form as "<a
      href="http://www.dataprotocols.org/en/latest/data-packages.html">data
      packages</a>" and SHOULD be in <a href="http://www.dataprotocols.org/en/latest/simple-data-format.html">Simple Data Format</a>. We also recommend storing in
    a git repo on GitHub. Simple Data Format Data Packages are designed to be <strong>very
      simple</strong> but still have <strong>just enough structure</strong> to be
    usable by tools. You can check out <a
      href="http://github.com/datasets/gdp">an existing, exemplar data package
      (GDP) on GitHub here</a>.</p>

    <h4>Structure</h4>
    <p>A Data Package has the following structure on disk:</p>
    <pre>
datapackage.json   # metadata and data schemas for this data package
README.md          # [Optional] README in markdown format
my-data.csv        # one or more data files in CSV format
  </pre>
    <h4>datapackage.json</h4>
    <p><code>datapackage.json</code> is the central file in a Data Package as it
    provides both general metadata and schema information in a structured form
    that is machine usable. It is a JSON file and full details of its structure are in the <a href="http://www.dataprotocols.org/en/latest/data-packages.html">data packages specification</a>.</p>

    <h4>Data files</h4>
    <p>All data must be provided as CSV files (UTF8 encoded). We recommend having <strong>only one</strong> data file in a data package. See the <a href="http://www.dataprotocols.org/en/latest/simple-data-format.html">Simple Data Format specification</a> for more information.</p>

    <h3 id="assessment">Assessment Criteria</h3>
    <p>For dataset to become officially published &ndash; and therefore featured on this site &ndash; it is assessed against the following criteria:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Quality - the dataset must be well structured</li>
      <li>Relevance and importance - the focus at present is on indicators and reference data</li>
      <li>Ongoing support - it should have a maintainer</li>
      <li>Openness - data should be <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">open data</a> and openly licensed in accordance with the <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">Open Definition</a></li>
    </ul>
